# Christmas Sales and Trend Analysis.

The dataset is rich,encompassing comprehensive information on Age,Gender,Location,Stores,Product,Product Category,Total Price etcetera of various customers who took part in various Christmas sales period.


## Project Steps
I quickly reviewed the data in Microsoft Excel,then imported it into a Jupyter notebook where I used the appropriate libraries to extract and clean the data.After that,I conducted thorough exploratory data analysis.For data visualization, I utilized Microsoft PowerBi, and created reports using Google Docs.

This data was slightly and all the data analysis were presented in notebooks and documented in the docs file for easy interpretation and all visualizations are in the Microsoft PowerBi worksheet.
## Future Works
Looking forward to working with more features and also exploring more season sales and trend during the course of the next year.
